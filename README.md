This repo is named `moose`, for obvious reasons.

The scripts in this repo help me (and anyone else) get setup on a GCP Compute Engine VM.

The scripts should be used in this fashion.
```
$ ./install.sh
$ source ~/.profile
$ ./setup.sh
```

Alternatively, for the lazy, give this a go.
```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankeesler/moose/master/lazy.sh | bash
```
